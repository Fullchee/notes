## React Fundamentals

1. `React.createElement` is like `document.createElement()`
2. `document.append(element)` is like `ReactDOM.render(reactComponent, document.body)`
   1. ReactDOM because react can be rendered in many environments (example: React Native)

### PropTypes confusion

I got a bit confused when I got to creating custom components extra credit where I'm not sure how React is calling the `propTypes` that we defined (not from the library).

- [Course video link](https://epicreact.dev/modules/react-fundamentals/creating-custom-components-extra-credit-solution-03)
- [Link to code](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals/blob/main/src/final/04.extra-3.html)

I broke it down in [this StackOverflow question]([https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70477035/when-are-the-props-propname-and-componentname-passed-to-the-proptypes-func]) where I even tried looking at the `React` source code but I didn't explain my question clearly enough because the one response gave a link to the `propTypes`.

- (which is interesting but not exactly what I'm looking for ðŸ˜…)

I'm also posted on KCD's discord and I'm likely going to go to his office hours next Monday (Jan 10, 2022)
