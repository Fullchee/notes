# Why so many programming languages?

One of the first dilemmas someone first learning how to program is:

What programming language should I learn?

which then leads to the question

Why are there so many in the first place?

  

The immediate answer to this question is that some languages are designed to make it easier to do certain things (Ruby for web development, bash for Linux scripts)

What makes these programming languages special isnâ€™t the language itself but the frameworks (tools) around it.

The reason why these frameworks exist is because of history.

The main reason why bash is an appropriate language for Linux scripts is because of its universal adoption on \*NIX systems systems.

Ruby is only great for web development because people made it easy for Ruby and to build cool frameworks like Ruby on Rails that make it easier for a trained person to quickly build websites.
