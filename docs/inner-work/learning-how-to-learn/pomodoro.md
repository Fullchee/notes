# Pomodoro

Date: 2022-01-03

## History

-   I've really struggled with pomodoros
-   I don't like how it gets me out of the zone
-   and how it leads to context switching
-   I keep coming back to it
    -   maybe my 10th time of trying pomodoros again
    -   because my autopilot is
        -   less productive because it leads to burnout
        -   I want to learn how to pace myself

I'm going to write some of my resistance here

## New approach I'm trying in 2022

-   when taking a break, I won't actually distract myself, I'll
-   I'll force myself to break tasks down
    -   and have some sort of warning when there's 5 minutes left
-   let go of the mentality of "there's still time to do something" when there's only ~1 minute left

Jan 14 Update

-   I've already stopped using Pomodoros
-   it's tough
-   something more effective is building natural breakpoints at work
