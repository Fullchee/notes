## Why test

Confidence

-   that it works
-   when refactoring

### 01: What RTL does

-   all tests render a component
-   do something once it's rendered
-   then tear it down
-   RTL removes boilerplate
    -   and has nice practices
        -   isolation of tests
        -   testing like the user would
