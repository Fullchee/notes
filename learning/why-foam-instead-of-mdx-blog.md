# Why Foam instead of MDX

Date: 2022-01-03

## Nicer UX

- the UX is just nicer (tab will indent lists)
- pasting images is super nice with foam
  - the UX with MDX is manually copying
- table of contents markdown creator/updater VSCode extension

### Lesser points

- I can use (beautify) WYSIWYG markdown editors like [Typora](https://typora.io/) or [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)
  - because I'm now just using regular Markdown (although I could get away with using MDX with those editors)
- I haven't really used MDX that much anyway
