It's also tremendously useful in spotting knowledge gaps when I'm unable to Why I'm quitting I used it as a distraction 2. if I want to be the most productive version of myself, I need to rest my brain instead of doing flashcards as a default. It just led me to burnout. 3. I would often do flashcards late into the night before bed because I wanted the algorithm to work get that check mark. I want Just-In-Time (JIT) learning 3. I can't know everything and the pipeline to get info into long term memory. 4. Unlike in school, I don't have to memorize everything. I can search things up on Google or in this repo. My history of using Anki \u00b6 It looks like I started using Anki in 2016. I think I was in 3rd year and I tried Anki flashcards for my Testing and Verification course (CSC410). I was frustrated at how I would forget almost everything that I learned in my courses. I still believe that Anki is a great way to learn things long term. It's funny because now I've deleted almost all of those cards that I created in 2016. However, I ended up not using Anki for long because it wasn't optimal for me in university.

Analogy: The printing press \u00b6 There were precursors to the printing press 400+ years before Gutenberg invented it in Germany. The printing press worked in Europe because most languages there have a small number of letters It didn't catch on in China because there is no alphabet. In programming, it's just easier to do some things in some programming languages Here are some printing presses for some languages JavaScript comes with the browser => easy to make web apps Java easy to make Android apps historical reason: easy to write an app once that works on a ton of machines Ruby easy to build web apps with the Ruby on Rails framework Bash universal adoption on *NIX systems makes it easy to write scripts that will work on most servers Why Python? \u00b6 If a language only gets popular after people make things with it to make the language useful, isn't that a catch 22? You need to be popular to be more popular? Aesthetics \u00b6 Some languages like the romantic languages (French, Italian, Spanish) sound nice which gives someone a reason to learn the language. Python has a lot of nice features and it's nice to write concise programs that are pleasant to read and write. Ease of use \u00b6 Python is one of the top languages that English speakers learn. That's because it feels more like a human language than many other programming languages. Utility \u00b6 With aesthetics, and ease of use, early adopters started making tons of libraries for anything you can think of from machine learning to web applications. Once a language it hits some critical point, it just gets more and more popular. Why so many languages? \u00b6 As people learn how to program, they notice that it's hard to do certain things with existing languages. They think they can do better so they write another language. Or they might just think it's fun to make new languages and it gains popularity. New languages are still being created today! \ud83d\ude80 The general purpose programming languages that will overtake Python as the one of the popular languages is likely a newer version of Python. There's always new features being added to the core language to make things even easier as our needs as software developers change. Brand new languages also being created!
